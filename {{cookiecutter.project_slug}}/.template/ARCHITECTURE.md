# Architecture

<!-- Fill this out if you end up building a codebase / system with some level of complexity -->

<!-- There should be enough information here to describe a mental model of the codebase and how the code here is being used -->
<!-- Two examples: -->
<!-- https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/architecture.md -->
<!-- https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/documentation/internal_architecture.md -->


<!-- Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/le46br/why_you_need_architecturemd/). -->
