# Design intent

As mentioned in the readme, design intent is :

> Minimal enough to stay out of your way when starting a project, sufficiently adaptable to remain useful as the project evolves.

+ Project template, as well as a set of guidelines
+ Meant to start bare bones and grow with the project as required
+ Extra components and template documentation are stowed away in a hidden `.template` directory until they are needed. 

## Reasoning

Not uncommon for DS projects to start small and adhoc, then balloon into something. Thus makes sense to have sth that barely takes any effort to set up and use so even the most adhoc of data work starts structured. Also prevents you from revisiting a repo from donkey months ago with no recollection of what happened in here

Not recommnded for projects involving large teams however. Stick to a larger, more structured repo. Better for team.
