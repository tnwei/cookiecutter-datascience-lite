# cookiecutter-datascience-lite

Light [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for starting data science projects, contains minimal scaffolding to get started quickly. This repo is a WIP, predominantly focused on usage on Linux.

## Motivation

Used [cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) for a bit, personally grew to prefer starting projects with a clutter-free bare minimum project structure, and gradually expanding the project as needed.

## Usage

After installing the `cookiecutter` Python package, run `cookiecutter github.com/tnwei/cookiecutter-datascience-lite` to create a new project repo. Caution: early work in progress!
